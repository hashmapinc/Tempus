The metric server has been deployed. 
{{ if .Values.apiService.create }}
In a few minutes you should be able to list metrics using the following
command:

  kubectl get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes"
{{ else }}
NOTE: You have disabled the API service creation for this release. The metrics
API will not work with this release unless you configure the metrics API
service outside of this Helm chart.
