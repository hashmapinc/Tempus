## Features

Tempus was made to simplify ingest/analysis/storage/visualization of your IIoT data. The key features include:

- Device Management
  - Configure and Control your edge devices and acquistion conifigurations
  - This can range from simple data ingestion to complex data analysis and transformation
- Security
  - Data transmission via MQTT over TLS
  - Device authorization via Tokens or X.509 certificates

    - OPC-UA
    - WITSML 1.3.1.1/1.4.1.1 (as a client)
    - Sparkplug B
    - Apache NiFi (via any flow, using the Tempus supplied NAR files to transmit data to the system via MQTT)
- Built in Rules engine for Data flow
  - Using visually-created rules, data can be routed where it needs to go, when it needs to go
  - Data formatting provided by Apache Velocity
- Designed for extensiblity
  - Ability to integrate with any system on the backend. Out of the box support for:
    - Apache Kafka
    - AWS SQS/SNS
    - AWS Kinesis Data Stream/Firehose Delivery Stream
    - Kudu
    - HBase
    - MQTT
    - REST API endpoints
- Comprehensive Visualization System
  - Ability to create drill down and specific views that include
    - Charts
    - Maps
    - Gauges
    - Digital I/O
    - and more
- Scalable
  - Scales with a zero-master clustering model (orchestrated by Zookeeper)
- Configurable Storage
  - Built in data store support for:
    - HSQLDB (Demos/Development/Testing)
    - PostgreSQL
    - Cassandra (recommended for production)
  - Caching support via Redis

## Requirements

* JDK 1.8 or newer
* Apache Maven 3.1.0 or newer
* Git Client

## Getting Started

- Read through the [Tempus Developer Quickstart](https://tempus.readthedocs.io/development/quickstart.html/).
  It will include a section on how to build the local development environment via Docker to get you up and running quickly.

To build:
- Execute `mvn clean install` or for parallel build execute `mvn -T 2.0C clean install`. On a
  modest development laptop that is a couple of years old, the latter build takes a bit under fifteen
  minutes. After a large amount of output you should eventually see a success message.
